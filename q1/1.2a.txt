The statement is true. The statement is true. The statement is correct. A multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activations is more expressive than logistic regression, especially when dealing with non-linear patterns in raw pixel data. However, training an MLP is more challenging due to non-convex optimization, making it sensitive to issues like vanishing gradients and multiple local minima. So, while MLPs offer greater expressiveness, logistic regression is easier to train because it involves convex optimization.
